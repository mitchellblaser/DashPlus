<h1> DashPlus</h1>

<h5>An improved FRC Dashboard with user-customizeable controls.</h5>

This project makes use of *Raylib* and *WPILib*, and requires cmake and g++ installed. This repo includes pre-built source for both platforms to run under linux, however to compile for a different target system you may need to recompile, also using cmake. For instructions on how to do this, refer to each library's repositories.

<h4>Installation Instructions:</h4>

Currently the application is not in a working state, but you can build the current source code with the dpbuild script in the root of the repository.

The script comes with two flags: ``--clean`` and ``--run``.

Run it with ``./dpbuild --clean --run`` to build the software for your system and run the file once complete.
