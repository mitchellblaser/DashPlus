<h1> DashPlus</h1>

<h5>An improved FRC Dashboard with user-customizeable controls.</h5>



<h4>Installation Instructions:</h4>

Currently the application is not in a working state, but you can build the current source code with the dpbuild script in the root of the repository.

The script comes with two flags: ``--clean`` and ``--run``.

Run it with ``./dpbuild --clean --run`` to build the software for your system and run the file once complete.
