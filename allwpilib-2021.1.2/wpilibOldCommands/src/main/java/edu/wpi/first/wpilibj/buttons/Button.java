 * This class provides an easy way to link commands to OI inputs.

 * of a joystick to a "score" command.
 *
 * <p>This class represents a subclass of Trigger that is specifically aimed at buttons on an
 * operator interface as a common use case of the more generalized Trigger objects. This is a simple
 * wrapper around Trigger with the method names renamed to fit the Button object use.
