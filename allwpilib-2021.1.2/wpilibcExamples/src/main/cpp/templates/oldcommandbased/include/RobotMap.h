/**
 * The RobotMap is a mapping from the ports sensors and actuators are wired into

// For example to map the left and right motors, you could define the
// following variables to use with your drivetrain subsystem.
// constexpr int kLeftMotor = 1;
// constexpr int kRightMotor = 2;

// If you are using multiple modules, make sure to define both the port
// number and the module. For example you with a rangefinder:
// constexpr int kRangeFinderPort = 1;
// constexpr int kRangeFinderModule = 1;
